Easyrest is a typescript library for building RESTful APis without repeating yourself. It takes care about all aspects that cause a headache in a RESTful API developing process.

Easyrest offers:
1. Simple entities architecture, which allows to design your api using small amount of code.
2. Ability to use it with any possible web framework. It doesn't have any framework specific features or something similar.
3. Ability to use different approaches to fetch data. For an every entity you should provide a fetcher, mutator, and deleter functions. You decide by yourself how it will work inside.

## Getting started

```
npm install @shevelidze/easyrest
